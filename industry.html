<h1>Industry Exploration</h1>

<p>YouTube is a social media company and website where people upload videos to share with 
other people and comment on other people's videos.

YouTube excites me because I like to watch YouTube videos.  They are great sources of 
entertainment.  They also cure bordom and help relieve stress after I have had a rough moment 
or a bad day.

I think that working as a YouTube content creator would be a great job for me.  YouTube content creators
are basically the same as YouTubers. They create videos and then upload them onto YouTube to share
with others.  I think that it is a good job for me because not only am I good at making videos 
but I am also good at editing and even adding effects to them. I am also good at photo editing.
I use computers, iPads, and phones on a daily basis.  I mainly use them for entertainment 
and for doing homework sometimes. I would like to spend my time learning more about computers and 
software, especially multimedia software.  The hardest part about this is the coding.  
I like to edit photos and videos because it allows me to be creative.  I don't find any of 
the industry boring.  I just find the coding difficult and frustrating because it is
not only time-consuming, but it is also very confusing.</p>
