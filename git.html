<h1>My reaction to Git<h1>
<p>To me, Git is both easy and hard to use. The easiest part about Git is typing things into Terminal.
The hardest part is actually the pushing things into the repository part. In fact, I was unable to 
finish it due to errors constantly popping up when trying to push. Terminal is easy to use, but it has many 
issues and errors which is frustrating. The errors are the most confusing thing about Git.</p>    

<p>Unfortunately I am unable to provide screenshots due to experiencing issues with attaching images from 
files from my computer.  However, I am able to provide links to the GitHub pages instead. Their significance 
is to show what the sites look like.
