<h1>My reaction to Git<h1>
<p>To me, Git is both easy and hard to use. At first, I was intimidated by it, but it got easier
after a while. The easiest part about Git is typing things into Terminal. While getting Terminal
to actually run the commands is hard, the hardest part is actually pushing things into the repository. 
In fact, I was unable to finish it due to errors constantly popping up when trying to push. Terminal is 
easy to use, but it has many issues and errors which is frustrating. The errors are the most confusing 
thing about Git.</p>    

<p>The screenshots' significance is to show what the sites look like. They also let others see your work
without actually going on the site if you are having issues with building the site, like I did.</p>

<p>Challenges</p>

<p>GitHub was easy to use. At first I got a 404 page when I tried to access it for the first few times and 
I thought that it maybe have errors or that it does not support it.  Then after I went on my GitHub account
I found out that the pages did work and that everything was pushed into my repository; I had to highlight the link 
near the top of the page then copy and paste it on the URL and then delete a few words in order for it to show up.
(see pic below)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it does not work for every page that I upload.  Since I have multiple pages with "index.html", Github replaces
the current one that I have with another totally different page each and every time.</p>
