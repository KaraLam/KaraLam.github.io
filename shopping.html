<h1>Shopping websites<h2>
<p>Whether you want to buy something for yourself because it's your birthday or 
Christmas, or because the item you want is not available in stores, these websites
can help. They sell almost anything and everything.</p>

<div class="flex-container">

       <p>Amazon offers a lot of products that you can't seem to find in stores anywhere.
       If you can't find it at stores, you may find it here.</p>

  <div><p>Ebay</p>

        width="100%"; height="10%" alt="ebay logo">

       <p>Ebay ot only sells new things, but they also sell used and discontinued things.
          The items can be very expensive, but it is worth it.</p>

        <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a></div>


  <div><p>Craigslist</p>

        width="100%"; height="10%" alt="craigslist logo">

       <p>This site sells used stuff.  The prices are much cheaper than Ebay.  The sellers
          usually want you to meet up with them if  you are interested buying
          stuff from them so safety is important when you use this site to buy things.</p>

  <div><p>Offerup</p>

        width="100%"; height="10%" alt="offerup logo">

       <p>This site is very similar to Craigslist.  It sells used stuff, too. 
          It is not as popular than Craigslist, though.</p>
